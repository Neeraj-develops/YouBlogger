        <p>If you’re new to the field of software development, the toughest part of learning programming is deciding
            where to begin. There are hundreds of programming languages in widespread use, each with its own
            complexities and idiosyncrasies.</p>

        <p>The good news is that as you begin your journey as a software developer, you’ll start to discover which
            programming language will be most suitable for you, your interests, and your career goals.</p>

        <h2 class="heading1">1. JavaScript</h2>
        <p>

            It’s impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript in some way. According to
            Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language among developers for the
            eighth year in a row. Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents reported that they had used JavaScript in the
            past year.

            Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is essential to front-end web development. A majority of the web’s most
            popular sites, from Facebook and Twitter to Gmail and YouTube, rely on JavaScript to create interactive web
            pages and dynamically display content to users.</p>

        <h2 class="heading1">2. Swift</h2>
        <p>

            If you’re interested in Apple products and mobile app development, Swift is a good place to start. First
            announced by Apple in 2014, Swift is a relatively new programming language used to develop iOS and macOS
            applications.

            Swift has been optimized for performance and built from the ground up to match the realities of modern iOS
            development. Not only does iOS run on every iPhone and iPad, but it’s also the basis for other operating
            systems such as watchOS (for Apple Watches) and tvOS (for Apple TVs). In addition, Apple isn't going
            anywhere as a tech industry leader, and iOS apps continue to be the most profitable in the mobile app
            marketplace.</p>

        <h2 class="heading1">3. Scala</h2>
        <p>

            If you’re familiar with Java—a classic programming language in its own right—it’s worth checking out its
            modern cousin, Scala. Scala combines the best features of Java (such as its Object-Oriented Structure and
            its lightning-fast JVM runtime environment) with a modern twist.

            As a functional programming language, Scala allows engineers to elevate the quality of their code to
            resemble pure math. Scala allows for concurrent programming, allowing complex procedures to be executed in
            parallel. </p>

        <h2 class="heading1">4. Go</h2>
        <p>

            One of the core languages favored by Google, Go is the little language that could. As a low-level language,
            Go is ideal for engineers who want to enter the field of systems programming. It encompasses much of the
            same functionality of C and C++ without the difficult syntax and steep learning curve. It’s the perfect
            language for building web servers, data pipelines, and even machine-learning packages.</p>

        <h2 class="heading1">5. Python</h2>
        <p>

            Python is perhaps the most user-friendly programming language of any on this list. It’s often said that
            Python’s syntax is clear, intuitive, and almost English-like, which, like Java, makes it a popular choice
            for beginners.

            Also like Java, Python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile, powerful option when choosing
            the best programming language for your use case. If you’re interested in back-end web development, for
            example, then the open-source Django framework, written in Python, is popular, easy to learn, and
            feature-rich. Django has been used in the development of some popular sites like Mozilla, Instagram, and
            Spotify.</p>
